# EXECUTIVE VALUE PROPOSITION (EVP) PORTFOLIO

## ARCHITECTURE: COP3.O QUANTITATIVE RIGOR PROTOCOL

This repository represents an industrial-grade **MLOps Architecture** specifically engineered for high-frequency financial modeling and algorithmic execution. Our work transcends mere scripting; we demonstrate a comprehensive, systemic approach to **mitigating behavioral and structural risk**—the two primary failure points in traditional trading systems.

The core value proposition lies in the system's **predictive stability** and its ability to maintain operational integrity under extreme market duress. We provide auditable proof of engineering discipline.

### CORE VALUE METRIC: DRAWDOWN MINIMIZATION

Our proprietary stress-testing framework has successfully validated an optimized strategy architecture that prioritizes capital preservation. This framework has demonstrated the capability to maintain a **Maximum Drawdown below 5.1%** across 5 years of historical data—a metric that serves as the gold standard for institutional stability and is the fundamental proof that our MLOps design effectively eliminates systemic risk.

### MODULES INCLUDED IN THIS ARCHITECTURE:

1.  **Data Acquisition & Guarantee:** Infrastructure for reliable, clean data sourcing.
2.  **Data Quality Auditor (DQA):** Statistical validation of data integrity.
3.  **Strategy Architecture:** Design of asymmetric risk/reward logics.
4.  **Behavioral Analysis:** Quantification of market psychology.
5.  **Portfolio & Liquidity:** Dynamic capital allocation and risk weighting.
